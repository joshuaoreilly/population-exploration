    "# How Big is Canada, Really?\n",
    "\n",
    "Canada is the second largest country in the world by area, but most of it is virtually uninhabited. In 2016, 66% of the Canadian population lived within [100km](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/170208/dq170208a-eng.htm) of the US border.\n",
    "I've been curious for a long while now, how big is Canada really, if we only include area that has a certain population density or higher?\n",
    "\n",
    "A naive approach would to go to every country's own statistics/census website, wrestle with their chosen data accessing and formatting patterns.\n",
    "A slightly smarter approach is to let someone else do it for us, and use their results.\n",
    "Luckily, the [Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center (sedac)](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4) has done this since 1995.\n",
    "\n",
    "I originally downloaded their Population Density dataset v4.11, which contains ASCII and TIFF files of data up to a resolution of 30 arc-second.\n",
    "Unfortunately, I couldn't think of a convenient way of figuring out which pixels belong to each country.\n",
    "A much easier approach is to use the Administrative Unit Center Points with Population Estimates dataset, which gives, per administrative unit in a given country, its population, area, density, and more, which makes our job easy as pie.\n",
    "There's definitely some resolution lost by solving this way, since a gigantic admin unit could hypothetically have everyone concentrated in a single square kilometer, and we'd never know.\n",
    "Something to look out for when we start wrangling the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 1: Download Data\n",
    "\n",
    "I went over the the link above (or [here](https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/collection/gpw-v4), same link), created an account, selected Global/Regional as the Geography, Comma Separated Value as the file format, and then ticked the Global box, which contains a single CSV for the world minus the US, then four separate CSV for the latter. While ticking the per-continent boxes was an option, I'm here to make unbased claims against Mapleland, not parallelize my work or be considerate of the hardware of others. According to [Jeff](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25962114/how-do-i-read-a-large-csv-file-with-pandas), it takes about double the size of a CSV file to open it in Pandas; since the largest file is just over 3GB, I didn't think it would cause any issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also downloaded the documentation, since it describes the column titles used below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Step 2: Load, Trim, Permute, and Save\n",
    "\n",
    "Next step was pretty straightforward; load each CSV, remove all columns but the country, density, and area (I kept population too for maybe futzing around later), and save it all to a CSV for probably faster loading if I ever want to open these again."

[Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/95-640-x/2011001/p1/p1-01-eng.htm) lists 160 155 748 acres of farmland in Canada in 2011, or 648 127sqkm. With about [241 500](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/sector/overview) jobs in primary agriculture, that comes out to 2.68 people per square kilometer, significantly lower than the global average, and a generous threshold to let Canada keep some area in the upcoming smackdown.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can look at the least dense US state and use that as our threshold. Why? No clue, seems like fun. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population_density) to the rescue, which reports Alaska as our lucky winner with an average population density of 0.5 people per sqkm. I was originally going to exclude Alaska, since I figured it would be ridiculously low, but considering the second lowest, Wyoming, has a density of 2.3 people per sqkm, which is about the same as for the average Canadian farm, looks like we're using our friend up north and being even more gentle with Canada's new area.\n",
